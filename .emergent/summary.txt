The AI engineer successfully progressed the TicketAI platform through multiple feature additions and refinements. Initially, the focus was on implementing the Promoter CRM (backend APIs, frontend pages, and integration). This involved creating new routes, securing pages, seeding mock data, and extensive testing. Following this, the user requested streamlining CRM access with a 30-day free trial, leading to the creation of a Demo CRM page and associated trial logic. A significant pivot then occurred, transforming the Demo CRM into an Instagram-style community page, which required substantial frontend restructuring and icon error resolution. Finally, the user requested integrating direct Stripe payment links for support, which is the current task, specifically updating the . Throughout the process, the engineer addressed navigation issues, handled authentication logic, and ensured backend API functionality.

TicketAI is an evolving full-stack platform for event discovery and management, initially focused on Event Trading and later pivoting to AI-Powered Event Discovery. Key features include AI search and personalized recommendations, a Promoter Dashboard for event management and credit tracking (Boost My Post), and monetization via pricing, merchandise (with a 1.5 credit fee for external platforms), and Stripe donations (floating support banner). The platform also supports Live Streaming with monetization and analytics, and provides an enhanced user experience with a My Tickets page and an AI chatbot.
The most recent development focused on a B2B Promoter CRM for sales, audience, and marketing management. This includes a 30-day free trial with top-up/subscription pricing, a social media-style community page for engagement, and a non-blocking contact popup for lead capture. The current request is to integrate direct Stripe payment links for the support banner for one-time payments (£5, £15, £50).

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was in the process of integrating direct Stripe payment links into the existing  component for pay-as-you-go and subscription support options. The user provided three specific Stripe payment links for £5, £15, and £50 donations, along with the request to change the currency displayed to GBP (£). The engineer has identified the  file and is about to modify it to replace the existing Stripe integration logic with redirects to these provided direct payment links. This involves updating the UI to reflect the GBP currency and ensuring each tier's button correctly redirects to its respective Stripe checkout URL.
