<analysis>
The previous AI engineer initiated the development of a full-stack ticketing application, TicketAI, using React for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The initial phase focused on building core ticketing functionality, including event listing and booking, along with AI recommendations. A significant challenge involved backend startup errors and syntax fixes. Subsequently, the engineer integrated AI-powered search and TicketMaster event listings, responding to user feedback for enhanced discovery. Key decisions included leveraging Shadcn UI for a modern frontend, using UUIDs for MongoDB IDs, and employing specialized agents for third-party integrations (e.g., LLMs, SendGrid, Stripe). The work progressed through multiple iterations of feature implementation, testing, and UI refinement based on user feedback and screenshot reviews. The engineer consistently addressed issues, particularly with backend stability and AI response formatting. The current work involves implementing a comprehensive SaaS pricing and credit system.

**Future Enhancements (Explicitly Requested):**
- **Critical Missing Features:** Real Payment Integration (Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay), Ticket Resale/Secondary Market, Enhanced TicketMaster Integration (real API purchase, inventory sync), Event Management Dashboard.
- **User Experience Enhancements:** Social Features (reviews, ratings, sharing), Wishlist/Favorites, Advanced Notifications (email, SMS, push), Calendar Integration.
- **AI Search & Personalization (Phased Plan):** Semantic Search, Natural Language Queries, Contextual Filters, User Preference Learning, Dynamic Recommendations, Collaborative Filtering, Voice Search, Autocomplete & Smart Suggestions, Synonym Recognition, AI-Powered Categorization, Trend Analysis, Geo-Aware Search, Conversational AI/Chatbot, Predictive Analytics.
- **SaaS Pricing & Credit System:** Pay-as-you-go credit packs, free trial, custom plans.

<current_work>
The previous AI engineer was in the process of implementing a comprehensive pricing and credit system for the TicketAI platform. This is a critical step towards transforming the application into a functional SaaS platform with a pay-as-you-go model. This involves creating a dedicated pricing page in the frontend, developing backend logic for credit management, and integrating payment gateways (like Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay) to handle credit purchases. The user explicitly detailed the desired credit packs, their prices, and the number of searches included, indicating a need for both frontend UI for displaying these options and backend logic to process transactions and manage user credit balances. This work follows the user's detailed feedback on Key Improvements Needed for the platform.
