The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive event ticketing platform, TicketAI, evolving it from a basic React/FastAPI/MongoDB setup to an AI-powered system. Initial efforts focused on core event listing, booking, and AI recommendations. A major iteration involved integrating TicketMaster events and a natural language AI search, requiring extensive backend and frontend modifications. Significant time was spent debugging  syntax errors related to XML tags. Later, the user requested an extensive list of advanced features, including real payment integration, ticket resale, event management, social features, and deep AI personalization. The engineer began implementing these, focusing on the AI search and personalization, creating an  and enhancing  and frontend components. The most recent task involves integrating user-provided UK festival data and addressing detailed UI/UX feedback. The last interaction introduced requirements for a Pay-As-You-Go credit system, which the AI accepted to implement next.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build an AI-powered event ticketing platform called TicketAI.
**Initial Requirements:**
*   **Frontend (React.js):** User interface for ticket selection, payment, QR code display, communicating with the backend via API Gateway.
*   **Backend (FastAPI):** Core logic, interaction with MongoDB, integration with AI/ML (OpenAI/SageMaker for recommendations, NLP), payment processing (Stripe), and storage (S3 for QR codes/images).
*   **API Gateway (AWS API Gateway):** Entry point, security, request routing.
*   **AI/ML Integration:** AI-powered features like ticket recommendations, content generation.
*   **Payment Processing (Stripe):** Secure online payments.
*   **Database (MongoDB):** Store user, ticket, and transaction details.
*   **Storage (S3):** Store ticket PDFs, QR codes, images.

**Enhancements (User requests):**
*   **AI Search Integration:** Add AI Search to the main page with natural language query capabilities.
*   **TicketMaster Integration:** Integrate ticket purchase and sales via TicketMaster, initially using demo/sandbox mode and showing TicketMaster events.
*   **Critical Missing Features:** Real payment integration (Stripe, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay), Ticket Resale/Secondary Market, Enhanced TicketMaster Integration (real API purchase flow, inventory sync), Event Management Dashboard.
*   **User Experience Enhancements:** Social features (reviews, ratings, sharing), Wishlist/Favorites, Advanced Notifications (email, SMS, push), Calendar Integration.
*   **Comprehensive AI Search & Personalization:** Implement semantic search, natural language queries, user preference learning, dynamic/collaborative recommendations, advanced discovery features (AI categorization, trend analysis, geo-aware search, synonym recognition), conversational AI (chatbot), and predictive analytics.
*   **Event Data Update:** Integrate provided UK festival data (Music, Art) for October-November 2025.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** Add Featured Events section, improve AI search experience (voice input, AI suggestions, confidence score), refine visual hierarchy (price, descriptions, images, categories), add event sorting options, include a Call to Action for organizers, clarify event source/booking actions with distinct buttons/labels.
*   **Pricing Model:** Implement a Pay-As-You-Go credit system with credit packs (Small, Medium, Large), free trial, custom plans, and a dedicated pricing page.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. Frontend and backend communicate via an API Gateway.



- ****: The main FastAPI application entry point. It has been extensively modified to include initial event APIs, user authentication (implicitly from package description), TicketMaster integration, AI search/recommendation endpoints, payment processing stubs, email sending, and a health check. It now imports from , , and .
- ****: Defines Pydantic models for various database entities like , , , , , etc., with UUIDs for IDs and proper datetime handling. This is crucial for data structure and validation.
- ****: This file was introduced to house services like Stripe payment integration, SendGrid email sending, and other utility functions. It has undergone several syntax fixes due to XML tag remnants.
- ****: This new file encapsulates the advanced AI functionalities, including event indexing for vector search, semantic search logic, and personalized recommendation generation using .
- ****: The main React component, now includes routing for the homepage, , , and .
- **, **: Basic structural components for navigation and layout.
- **, **: Handle displaying and listing events.  was modified to integrate AI search and TicketMaster events, and later updated to utilize .
- ****: Component for handling the booking process.
- **, **: Pages to display AI recommendations and search results, respectively. Both were updated to correctly render HTML-formatted AI responses.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has just completed integrating extensive UK festival data into the backend and creating a  component and route for the frontend to display these events. Immediately after this, the user provided detailed feedback on the current UI/UX, highlighting several areas for improvement such as adding a Featured Events section, enhancing the AI search experience, refining visual hierarchy, adding sorting options, and a call to action for organizers. The AI engineer has acknowledged this feedback and, as the very last action before this summary, has started addressing these UI/UX improvements by creating a new  component. Concurrently, the user also provided requirements for a comprehensive Pay-As-You-Go pricing and credit system, which the AI engineer has accepted to implement. The backend is stable, with comprehensive AI search and recommendation features implemented. The current work thus involves continuing the frontend UI/UX overhaul based on the user's detailed feedback, and then moving into the implementation of the new pricing and credit system for the platform.
